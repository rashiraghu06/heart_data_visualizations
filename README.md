# heart_visualizations_ml

This code was created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Final Project in CS 185C in SJSU.

The code reads in a csv file containing heart disease data. 

1. Unique questions using different types of plots are created.

2. A test set and a training set is created. 

3. A few ML classifiers are trained that can predict a binary outcome (survive or dead). N-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of each classifier.

4. A ROC plot that shows all the trained ML classifier's performance. 

5. The  ML classifiers are tested using the test set.
