1. Create and answer unique questions using different types of plots to help you understand the data. You can create additional categorical columns or reshape your data to help you understand the data.

2. Create a test set and a training set using the original dataset. 

3. Follow the steps that we use in Hands-ons 15 and 16 to prepare the data and pipeline for training a few ML classifiers that can predict a binary outcome (survive or dead). Use any strategy that you see fit. Use N-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each classifier.

4. Create a ROC plot that shows all the trained ML classifier's performance. Select the best one for testing.

5. Test your best ML classifier using the test set.
